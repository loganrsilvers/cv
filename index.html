      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Junior at Columbia College Chicago, it's a small art school downtown with a small 20-person programming department. I am currently in the Programming BA, but if they offered a Web Dev Degree I would be in that. I have been programming for about 5 years, and I have been working on web development for about 3 years. I am currently looking for a position that can combine my love of web development with my interest in early child development or teen education.
      </p>

    <section id="experience">
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my jobs I have held have been fun awesome hobby level jobs. I really enjoyed working while being a student and being able to stretch my brain to physically hold as much information as possible. I have worked at a few different places, but I am currently looking for a job that is more focused on web development skills.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lavener Education (CS/STEM SUMMER CAMP!)</strong> - Lead Instructor (2024)
          <p>I worked with kids aged 8-12 to help them build their own websites for the first time in a week long summer camp. We did a lot of JS confetti effects and fortnite references.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Columbia College Chicago (i know this is another student experience but stay with me here!)</strong> - The college's ONLY TUTOR for Web Dev and Programming (2023-Present)
          <p>I help students with their homework and projects, and I also help them learn new concepts in web development and programming. I have been able to help students with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, C++, and PHP.</p>
          <p>But most importantly I keep them <i>engaged</i> and <i>in love</i> with the major that they chose. Columbia has a <strong>30% retention rate</strong> which means that one million bajillion of the people i see are HIGHLY LIKELY to transfer or straight up drop out.</p>
          <p>I mean, I am sure you know because you have been there as a senior level coder or as an HR rep, but learning programming hard and I see it in the faces of the people who sit across from me <i>every day.</i></p>
          <p>The hardest part of this job is if I can't help them, I am not sure that anyone can. As tutors we are in trainings 5 hours a week every week on how to approach emotional and high stake student concerns, luckily I am an absolute BADASS and.  have the highest utilization rate of the whole school with a 96% usage rate so I am completely booked with both NEW students and REGULAR students who see me every week. I have so many web dev students i founded a club to try and help them get additional support as a new student in a teeny tiny college - and it <strong>workssss!!!</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stepping Stones NURSERY SCHOOLL!!</strong> So cute these tiny little toddlers. So cute. (2025-present)
          <p>I work with kids aged 1.5-5 to help them learn patience and sharing (honestly with these two things mastered they have practically graduated).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="portfolio">
      <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        My portfolio is a work in progress, but I have a few projects that I am proud of. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no getting around the fact that I am a student first and foremost, so please squint! You want my youthful spirit! I have worked on a few personal projects, but I am looking to expand my portfolio with more professional work. I have experience with HTML, CSS, a little bit of php, and a little bit of SQL, and I am currently learning p5.js and plain old JavaScript.
      </p>
      <a href="https://webdevclub.github.io/webdevclub.io/">I founded my college's first and only website club</a>
      <a href="wornoutproject.com">During my insternship at Hollister I created this website with a Cargo template and some custom CSS to give retail fashion companies some data from actual high schoolers in chicago (which is a targeted consumer market for them or so they lead me to believe)</a>
      <a href="https://loganrsilvers.github.io/web2/assignment4/index.html">This is a website that breaks itself over time which I made for both an assignment and an interview for a job to teach kids how to code websites. It was a really funny zoom call.</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/ketchupmaster987/Galaxypets?tab=readme-ov-file">Okay the actual link for this has expired because my groupmate was a senior and they graduated already but essentially this was an attempt at coding Neopets start to finish in a month</a>
